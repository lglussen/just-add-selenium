= Containerized Selenium Environment

This project focuses on creating a containerized environment for running Selenium.
The goal is to maintain a container with browsers & webdrivers and a virtual 
display configured to simulate a full graphical environment and capabilities to
transparently transition tests run on an OS into a containerized environment.

The container build is based around Fedora & RHEL/ubi to provide a path for
environments leaning into Red Hat solutions and supply chains.
